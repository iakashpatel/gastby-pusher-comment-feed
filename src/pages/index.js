    <h1>Leroy Aziz San√© left out of German squad for the world cup</h1>
    <p>
      A lot of talks is currently ongoing about the Manchester City winger Leroy Sane being left out of the German team.
      He was a prolific player this season with Mancity winning the premier league andthe significant contribution he brought to the team in front of Goal.
      The decision by the German coach, Low to leave him out of the squad list was totally unexpected. Football really is a funny sport.
